# Fuel-Queue-Management-System

This repository contains a Fuel Queue Management System implemented in Java using arrays and classes. The system simulates a fuel center with multiple fuel pumps where customers can wait in a queue and be served with a maximum of 10 liters of fuel each. The system keeps track of the remaining fuel stock and warns the operator when it reaches a minimum level.

The program has a console menu where the operator can perform various tasks such as adding or removing customers from a queue, viewing the queues' status, viewing the remaining fuel stock, adding more fuel to the stock, and saving or loading the program data to/from a file.

The program also has a GUI implemented using JavaFX, where the operator can view the passengers' details who are waiting in the fuel queue, search for a specific passenger, and see the waiting list queue's status.

The program has been thoroughly tested using various test cases to ensure its correctness and robustness. A table of test cases is provided in the report, along with a brief discussion of how the test cases were chosen to cover all aspects of the program. The entire code along with the test cases is included in the report.
